//! Utilities for tracking time.

//! This module provides a types for executing code after a set period of time.
//!
//! * [`Sleep`] is a future that does no work and completes at a specific [`Instant`]
//!   in time.
//!
//! * [`sleep`] and [`sleep_until`] provide ways to yield control away from a future
//!   for or until a specific instant in time.
