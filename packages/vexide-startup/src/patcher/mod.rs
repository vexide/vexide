/// Differential Upload Patcher
///
/// This function builds a modified version of the user program in memory with a binary patch (generated
/// by `bidiff` in cargo-v5) applied to it, then overwrites (self-modifies) the current program with the
/// newer version. This allows us to only upload a binary diff of what has changed from the original (the
/// "base") file, which is significantly smaller than reuploading the entire binary every time.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// Patching is performed in two steps. The first step is performed by this function, and involves
/// building the "newer" binary using the uploaded patch file and the current program as a reference.
/// The second step of patching is performed by the `__patcher_overwrite` assembly routine, which
/// is responsible for actually self-modifying the current program's active memory and preparing CPU1
/// to re-run the now patched program memory.
///
/// ## Stage 1 - Building the new binary
///
/// The first stage of patching involves building the new (patched) binary. When `cargo-v5` uploads a
/// new patch file to the brain, we tell it to load the file into memory at address `0x07A00000` â€” 6mb
/// from the end of the RWX memory block allocated to user code. This 6mb region of memory spanning
/// `0x07A00000`..`0x80000000` is reserved specifically for the patcher to use and is split into three
/// 2mb subregions (which will be discussed later).
///
/// In order to actually use the patch file to build a new binary, we need a reference to the original
/// "base binary" that it's patching over. The program running on the brain before the patch is applied
/// is always the original binary, so in the `_boot` routine (vexide's assembly entrypoint) we preemptively
/// make a copy of the currently running binary before any Rust code gets the chance to modify a writable
/// section of the binary like `.data` or `.bss` (which would corrupt the patch). This unmodified copy of
/// the old binary is copied to address `0x07C00000` (2mb after where our patch is loaded).
///
/// Finally, using the copy of the old binary and the patch, we are able to apply bidiff's [`bipatch`
/// algorithm](https://github.com/divvun/bidiff/blob/main/crates/bipatch/src/lib.rs) to build the new
/// binary file that we will run. This new binary is built at address `0x07E00000` (4mb after where our
/// patch is loaded).
///
/// ## Stage 2 - Overwriting the old binary with the new one
///
/// The second stage of the patch process is handled by the `__patcher_overwrite` assembly routine. This
/// routine is responsible for overwriting our currently running code with that new version we just built.
/// This involves memcpy-ing our new binary at `0x07E00000` to the start of user memory (`0x03800000`).
/// Doing this is far easier said than done though, and requires some important considerations as to not
/// shoot ourselves in the foot:
///
/// - When overwriting, it is *absolutely imperative* that the overwriter not depend on memory that is
///   in the process of being overwritten. This means that the overwriting routine must be done entirely
///   from a fixed address in memory and not reference any outside functions or data. We ensure this by
///   writing the entire stage-2 patch routine and memcpy implementation in assembly and placing these
///   instructions in a linker section (`.text.overwriter`) at a fixed address in memory.
///
/// - There is also a potential opportunity for soundness problems if the overwriter modifies itself while
///   running. This is more unlikely (due to the next point), but has bad implications if the patcher
///   self-modifies its own instructions while in the process running. Writing this part in assembly also
///   ensures this won't happen, because assembly will always compile down to the same instructions
///   regardless of how we tell our compiler to optimize our code. This routine will not change.
///
/// - Finally, there is the problem of cache coherency. ARMv7-A, like most modern architectures, caches
///   instructions fetched from memory into an on-chip L1 cache called the icache. There is also a similar
///   L1 cache called the dcache for memory/data accesses. ARM's cache model does not guarantee L1 cache will
///   always be synchronized (coherent) with what's actually present in physical memory when working with
///   self-modifying code, so we need to explicitly "clean" the instruction cache to bring it back to a
///   [point-of-unification (PoU)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0013/d/Caches/Point-of-coherency-and-unification)
///   with physical memory, ensuring that when we jump back to the start of our program, we are actually
///   executing from the newly overwritten memory rather than stale instructions from icache. This process
///   of invalidating and cleaning instruction caches is described to further detail in
///   [ARM's documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0013/latest/Caches/Invalidating-and-cleaning-cache-memory).
