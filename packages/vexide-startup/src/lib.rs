//! This crate provides a minimal startup routine for user code on the VEX V5 Brain.
//!
//! - User code begins at an assembly routine called `_boot`, which sets up the stack
//!   section before jumping to a user-provided `_start` symbol, which should be your
//!   rust entrypoint.
//!
//! - From there, the Rust entrypoint may call the [`startup`] function to finish the
//!   startup process by clearing the `.bss` section (intended for uninitialized data)
//!   and initializing vexide's heap allocator.
//!
//! This crate is NOT a crt0 implementation. No global constructors are called.
