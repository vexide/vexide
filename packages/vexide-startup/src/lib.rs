//! User program startup routines.
//!
//! This crate provides runtime infrastructure for booting VEX user programs from Rust code.
//!
//! - User code begins at an assembly routine called `_boot`, which sets up the stack
//!   section before jumping to a user-provided `_start` symbol, which should be your
//!   rust entrypoint.
//!
//! - From there, the Rust `_start` entrypoint may call the [`startup`] function to finish
//!   the startup process by clearing the `.bss` section (which stores uninitialized data)
//!   and initializing vexide's heap allocator.
//!
//! This crate does NOT provide a `libc` [crt0 implementation]. No `libc`-style global
//! constructors are called. This means that the [`__libc_init_array`] function must be
//! explicitly called if you wish to link to C libraries.
//!
//! [crt0 implementation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0
//! [`__libc_init_array`]: https://maskray.me/blog/2021-11-07-init-ctors-init-array
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! This is an example of a minimal user program that boots without using the main vexide
//! runtime or the `#[vexide::main]` macro.
//!
//! ```
//! #![no_main]
