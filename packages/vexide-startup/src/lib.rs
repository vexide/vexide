//! This crate provides a working entrypoint for the VEX V5 Brain.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Your entrypoint function should be an async function that takes a single argument of type [`Peripherals`](vexide_devices::peripherals::Peripherals).
//! It can return any type implementing [`Termination`](vexide_core::program::Termination).
//! ```rust
//! #[vexide::main]
//! async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) { ... }
//! ```
