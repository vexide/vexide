//! Support for capturing stack backtraces
//!
//! This module contains the support for capturing a stack backtrace through
//! the [`Backtrace`] type. Backtraces are helpful to attach to errors,
//! containing information that can be used to get a chain of where an error
//! was created.

/// A captured stack backtrace.
///
/// This type stores the backtrace of a captured stack at a certain point in
/// time. The backtrace is represented as a list of instruction pointers.
///
/// ```
/// let backtrace = Backtrace::capture();
/// println!("{backtrace}");
/// ```
///
/// ## Symbolication
///
/// The number stored in each frame is not particularly meaningful to humans on its own.
/// Using a tool such as `llvm-symbolizer` or `addr2line`, it can be turned into
/// a function name and line number to show what functions were being run at
/// the time of the backtrace's capture.
///
/// ```terminal
/// $ llvm-symbolizer -p -e ./target/armv7a-vex-v5/debug/program_name 0x380217b 0x380209b
/// my_function at /path/to/project/src/main.rs:30:14
///
/// main at /path/to/project/src/main.rs:21:9
/// ```
