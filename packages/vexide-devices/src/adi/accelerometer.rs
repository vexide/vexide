//! ADI Accelerometer
//!
//! This module provides an interface for the LIS344ALH-based three-axis analog accelerometer.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! The LIS344ALH capacitive accelerometer features signal conditioning, a 1-pole low pass filter,
//! temperature compensation and a jumper switch which allows for the selection of 2 sensitivities.
//! Zero-g offset full scale span and filter cut-off are factory set and require no external devices.
//!
//! The sensor will measure acceleration in both directions along each of the 3 axis. Acceleration
//! along the X or Y axis in the direction of the silkscreened arrows will produce a larger reading,
//! while acceleration in the opposite direction will produce a smaller reading. For the Z axis,
//! upward acceleration (in the direction of the board's face) produces larger values, and downward
//! acceleration (toward the board's back) produces lower values.
//!
//! # Gravity
//!
//! Gravity is indistinguishable from upward acceleration, so the sensor will detect a constant 1.0g
//! on the vertical axis while at rest. For example, if the board is mounted horizontally, gravity will
//! effect only the Z axis. If the sensor is tilted away from the horizontal, the gravity reading on the
//! Z axis will diminish, and the readings on the other axis will change depending on the sensor's
//! mounting orientation.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! Each axis on the accelerometer requires its own ADI port. This means that the accelerometer will take
//! three ADI ports if you wish to measure acceleration on all axes. You don't have to hook up all the
//! channels; you only need to connect the ones required for your application.
//!
//! The white (signal) wire of each cable goes near the 'X', 'Y', or 'Z' labels on the board. The black
//! (ground) wires go at the other end, adjacent to the 'B' label on the board. The center wire is for +5
//! volts. The sensor's mounting holes are electrically isolated from the circuit, meaning it is safe to
//! mount the device using screws on a robot.
