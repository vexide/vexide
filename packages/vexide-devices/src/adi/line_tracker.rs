//! ADI Line Tracker
//!
//! Line trackers read the difference between a black line and a white surface. They can
//! be used to follow a marked path on the ground.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! A line tracker consists of an analog infrared light sensor and an infrared LED.
//! It works by illuminating a surface with infrared light; the sensor then picks up
//! the reflected infrared radiation and, based on its intensity, determines the
//! reflectivity of the surface in question. White surfaces will reflect more light
//! than dark surfaces, resulting in their appearing brighter to the sensor. This
//! allows the sensor to detect a dark line on a white background, or a white line on
//! a dark background.
//!
//! The Line Tracking Sensor is an analog sensor, and it internally measures values in the
//! range of 0 to 4095 from 0-5V. Darker objects reflect less light, and are indicated by
//! higher numbers. Lighter objects reflect more light, and are indicated by lower numbers.
//!
//! # Effective Range
//!
//! For best results when using the Line Tracking Sensors, it is best to mount the sensors
//! between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch away from the surface it is measuring. It is also important
//! to keep lighting in the room consistent, so sensors' readings remain accurate.
