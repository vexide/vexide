//! ADI Potentiometer
//!
//! This module provides an interface for interacting with VEX's ADI potentiometers.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! Potentiometers are analog sensors that measure angular position. They function as
//! variable resistors that change their resistance based on the angular position of
//! their shaft.
//!
//! VEX offers two variants:
//!
//! - Legacy (EDR) Potentiometer: Provides measurements across a 250-degree range.
//! - V2 Potentiometer: Provides measurements across a 330-degree range.
//!
//! Both variants connect to the ADI ports and provide analog signals that are converted
//! to measurements of a shaft's angle.
//!
//! # Comparison to [`AdiEncoder`](super::encoder::AdiEncoder)
//!
//! Potentiometers are fundamentally *analog* sensors. They directly output a measurement
//! of their electrical resistance to the ADI port. The more a shaft rotates along a
//! conductive material inside of them, the higher the reported angle.
//!
//! With this in mind, this means that potentiometers are capable of measuring absolute
//! position at *all times*, even after they have lost power. Encoders on the other hand
//! can only track *changes in position* as a digital signal, meaning that any changes in
//! rotation under an encoder can only be recorded while the encoder is plugged in and
//! being read.
//!
//! # Comparison to [`RotationSensor`](crate::smart::rotation::RotationSensor)
//!
//! Rotation sensors operate similarly to a potentiometer, in that they know their absolute
//! angle at all times (even when being powered off). This is achieved through a hall-effect
//! sensor rather than a conductive material, however. Rotation sensors can also measure their
//! position along with their angle, similar to how an encoder can. They also have a full range
//! of motion and can track angle/position in a full 360-degree range. Potentiometers use ADI
//! ports while Rotation Sensors use Smart ports.
