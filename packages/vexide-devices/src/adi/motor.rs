//! ADI Motor Controller
//!
//! This module provides an interface for controlling motors over ADI using
//! PWM (Pulse-width Modulation) output. ADI motor control is typically done
//! using a physical hardware component between the brain and the motor itself
//! such as the [Motor Controller 29] to drive the motor.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! The two primary motors that this module is intended to control are the legacy
//! cortex-era [Motor 393] and Motor 269 units from VEX. These are fairly
//! standard DC motors that can be driven using standard voltage control or PWM,
//! with an integrated PTC breaker designed to prevent damage to the motors in
//! the event that they are overcurrent or stalled.
//!
//! While this module provides an API similar to that of a [Smart Motor], it is
//! in reality simply outputting an 8-bit PWM signal, which will be processed by
//! an intermediate motor controller (such as the MC29) to drive the motor using
//! an H-bridge circuit, allowing operation in either direction.
//!
//! Because these motors are no longer V5RC legal, they are not affected by
//! competition control restrictions, nor do they have any software-imposed
//! current limitations beyond the aforementioned PTC circuit.
