//! ADI Addressable LEDs
//!
//! This module provides an interface for controlling [WS2812B] addressable LED strips over ADI
//! ports. These are commonly used for decorative lighting. More can be read about using them in
//! [this blog post](https://sylvie.fyi/posts/v5-addrled/) and
//! [this forum post](https://www.vexforum.com/t/v5-addressable-leds/106960).
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! ADI ports are capable of controlling a WS2812B LED strip with up to 64 diodes per set of 8 ADI
//! ports. This limitation is due to the 2A current limit on ADI ports — plugging multiple strips
//! into the same set of ADI ports may cause your lights to flicker due to this limit being reached.
//! If you require more than 64 continuously running diodes, then you can run each strip through its
//! own [ADI Expander](crate::smart::expander::AdiExpander).
//!
//! The V5's ADI ports can present some technical challenges when interfacing with LEDs. Some
//! commercially available strips will not work with the V5 out of the box, but mileage may vary.
//! This is mainly caused by two "quirks" of the V5's ADI ports:
//!
//! - ADI ports operate at 3.3V digital logic, but most WS2812B strips expect 5V logic.
//! - The Brain's ADI ports include built-in short protection via a 1kΩ resistor that may impact
//!   signal timing on some strips, slowing down the edges of digital logic pulses sent to strip. In
//!   rare cases, this can cause issues with some strips.
//!
//! Using something like a [74HCT125 buffer] inline with the output to convert the 3.3-5V logic
//! addresses both these problems.
//!
//! # `smart-leds-trait` Integration
//!
//! vexide implements the [`SmartLedsWrite`] trait from the [`smart-leds-rs`](https://github.com/smart-leds-rs)
//! ecosystem on [`AdiAddrLed`]. This is useful if you need more advanced features for controlling
//! the strip, such as gradients or gamma correction.
