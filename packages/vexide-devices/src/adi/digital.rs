//! ADI Digital I/O
//!
//! ADI ports on the V5 brain are capable of sending and receiving digital signals
//! with external devices. Digital signals represent binary information using voltage levels
//! (called [logic levels](`LogicLevel`)) - they can only be in one of two states at any time.
//! Unlike analog signals which can take on any voltage within a range, digital signals are
//! either fully "on" (high) or fully "off" (low), making them ideal for simple sensors and
//! actuators such as buttons, switches and solenoids.
//!
//! # Hardware Description
//!
//! The ADI (Analog/Digital Interface) ports can be configured as either digital inputs or
//! outputs. When configured as inputs, they detect voltage levels to determine a logical high
//! (3.3V or above) or low (below 3.3V) state. When configured as outputs, they drive the pin
//! to either 3.3V (high) or 0V (low). These ports can be used with both direct brain connections
//! and through an ADI expander module.
