//! V5 Electromagnet
//!
//! The V5 electromagnet is a device unique to the V5 workcell kit. It is a simple
//! device that produces a magnetic field at a provided power level.
//! The power level does not have specific units.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! Not much information can be found on the V5 workcell electromagnet;
//! however, the electromagnet is intended to be used to pick up V5 Workcell colored disks.
//! We can assume that the lower bound on the electromagnet's strength is the weight of a V5 Workcell colored disk.
//! Assuming that the plastic part of the disk is made of ABS plastic and the metal part is solid iron,
//! the electromagnet can lift at least ≈0.24oz based off of the CAD model files for the V5 Workcell kit provided by VEX.
