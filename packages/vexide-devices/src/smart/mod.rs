//! Smart Ports & Devices
//!
//! This module provides abstractions over device access connected through VEX V5 Smart Ports. This
//! includes motors, many common sensors, vexlink, and raw serial access.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! The V5 brain features 21 RJ9 4p4c connector ports (known as "Smart Ports") for communicating with
//! newer V5 peripherals. Smart port devices have a variable sample rate (unlike ADI, which is limited
//! to 10ms), and can support basic data transfer over serial.
//!
//! # Smart Port Devices
//!
//! Most devices can be created with a `new` function that generally takes a port number along with other
//! device-specific parameters. All sensors are thread safe, however sensors can only be safely constructed
//! using the [`peripherals`](crate::peripherals) API.
//!
//! More specific info for each device is availible in their respective modules.
