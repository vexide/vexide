//! Distance Sensor
//!
//! This module provides an interface to interact with the VEX V5 Distance Sensor,
//! which uses a Class 1 laser to measure the distance, object size classification, and
//! relative velocity of a single object.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! The sensor uses a narrow-beam Class 1 laser (similar to phone proximity sensors)
//! for precise detection. It measures distances from 20mm to 2000mm with
//! varying accuracy (±15mm below 200mm, ±5% above 200mm).
//!
//! The sensor can classify detected objects by relative size, helping
//! distinguish between walls and field elements. It also measures the relative approach
//! velocity between the sensor and target.
//!
//! Due to the use of a laser, measurements are single-point and highly directional,
//! meaning that objects will only be detected when they are directly in front of the
//! sensor's field of view.
//!
//! Like all other Smart devices, VEXos will process sensor updates every 10mS.
