//! Peripheral Access
//!
//! This module is the gateway to all of your Brain’s available I/O — ports, hardware, and devices.
//! If you want to create a device like a sensor or motor or read from a controller, you are going to
//! need something off a struct in this module.
//!
//! This module provides safe access to underlying hardware by treating physical ports as unique
//! resources. The [`Peripherals`] struct stores ownership tokens for each hardware interface:
//!
//! - 21 Smart Ports for V5 devices
//! - 8 ADI ports for legacy devices
//! - [`Display`] instance.
//! - Instances for the primary and partner [`Controller`]s.
//!
//! These tokens can only be claimed once, preventing multiple parts of code from
//! accidentally controlling the same hardware.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The peripherals system uses a singleton pattern to ensure safe hardware access:
//! - Only one instance of [`Peripherals`] can exist at a time.
//! - Each port may only be claimed (owned by a device) once.
//! - Once claimed, a port cannot be used again until explicitly released.
//! - Ports cannot be cloned or copied. New ports cannot be safely created.
//!
//! By extension of this, only one mutable reference to a piece of hardware may exist. This
//! pattern of treating peripherals as a singleton is fairly common in the Rust embedded scene,
//! and is extensively coevered in [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/peripherals/singletons.html).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`Peripherals`] struct provides compile-time guarantees for exclusive port ownership.
//! This is best for when you know your port assignments at compile time.
//!
//! In vexide programs, a pre-initialized instance of this [`Peripherals`] struct is passed to your
//! program's entrypoint function:
//!
//! ```
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//!
//! use vexide::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[vexide::main]
//! async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
//!     println!("o.o what's this? {:?}", peripherals);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can then move ports or other peripherals out of this struct to create your devices:
//!
//! ```
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//!
//! use vexide::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[vexide::main]
//! async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
//!     let mut screen = peripherals.screen;
//!     let my_motor = Motor::new(
//!         peripherals.port_1,
//!         Gearset::Green,
//!         Direction::Forward,
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Dynamic Peripherals
//!
//! The [`DynamicPeripherals`] struct provides a more "flexible" way to claim ports at runtime while
//! maintaining safety guarantees. Instead of statically assigning ports at compile time, you can
//! request ports by number (e.g. port 1-21) during program execution. This is useful when:
//!
//! - You want to store unclaimed peripherals after claiming something, or pass your peripherals by value
//!   after taking something from it ([`Peripherals`] prevents this due to partial-move rules).
//! - Port assignments need to be configurable without recompiling.
//! - Port numbers need to be determined programmatically.
//!
//! The system still ensures only one device can use a port at a time, but handles the
//! bookkeeping at runtime rather than compile time. This trades a small performance cost
//! for increased flexibility, but is generally preferable to use the static [`Peripherals`]
//! struct at runtime.
