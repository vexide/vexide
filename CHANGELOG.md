### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with `Metadata::len` using the wrong condition. (#314)
- Fixed backwards assertion logic causing a panic in `AiVision::color` and `AiVision::set_color`. (#316)
- Symbols within the internal implementation of the patcher's `memcpy` will no longer clash with some libc compiler intrinsics. This should only matter if are linking to C libraries. (#314)

- Removed `LinkError::Nul`. (#240) (**Breaking Change**)
- Removed `LinkError::Port`, because it was broken. VEXlink will no longer perform port validation. (#243) (**Breaking Change**)
- Removed the `TextSize` enum. Use the associated constants on the new `FontSize` struct instead. (#248) (**Breaking Change**)

### New Contributors

@zabackary made their first contribution in #164!

## [0.4.2]

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue related to the calling convention of vex-sdk functions causing docs.rs api reference build failures. (#165)

### Changed

## [0.4.1]

### Added

### Fixed

- Updated to vex-sdk 0.21.0, fixing ABI incompatibilities between the VEXos calling convention and the hard-float ABI introduced in vexide 0.4.0. This should fix broken functions that pass floats to the SDK. (#156)

### Changed

### Removed

### New Contributors

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Added support for the V5 GPS Sensor (#79)
- Added support for custom banner themes configurable through the `vexide::main` macro (#127)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the distance sensor relative_size returned a u32 when it can be negative. (#116)
- Fixed an issue preventing the `Screen::draw_buffer` function from working properly. (#128)
- Fixed an issue where panic messages would not be displayed even when the `display_panics` feature was enabled if the screens render mode was set to `DoubleBuffered`. (#134)
- `GpsImu` should now validate on the correct port. (#141)

### Changed

- Refactored the distance sensor API. All readings from the sensor are now read at once in a `object` method that can be possibly `None` if no object was detected. (#122) (**Breaking Change**)
- Adjusted distance sensor status code errors to be more clear.
- Overhauled the design of the startup banner.
- Adjusted distance sensor error names. (#113) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed `SmartDevice::port_index` and `SmartPort::index` to `SmartDevice::port_number` and `SmartPort::port_number`. (#121) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed `AdiDevice::port_index` and `AdiPort::index` to `AdiDevice::port_number` and `AdiDevice::port_number`. (#121) (**Breaking Change**)
- `SmartPort::device_type` now no longer returns a `Result`. (#121) (**Breaking Change**)
- Updated the names of certain misspelled `enum` variants, constants, and fields. (#132) (**Breaking Change**)
- Marks many futures as `#[must_use]` to warn when futures are created without `await`ing them. (#112)
- Renamed `Screen` and its associated structs to `Display`. (#138) (**Breaking Change**)
- Changes the banner attribute syntax in the `vexide::main` macro. (#127) (**Breaking Change**)
- Controller joystick axis getters now return `f64` instead of `f32`. (#133) (**Breaking Change**)
- Fixed an issue where the async executor would block indefinetly on the first program run after a Brain reboot (#139)
- Removed the `critical_section` module from `vexide_core`, since vexide doesn't use interrupts and it can potentially break VEXos operations. (#144) (**Breaking Change**)
- Switched to a hard-float libm build with up to 6 times faster floating point operations. (#145)

### Removed

### New Contributors

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- The startup banner and code signature may now be configured using parameters passed to `vexide::main`. (#102)
- Added the ``ProgramOwner``, ``ProgramType``, and ``ProgramFlags`` types for code signature configuration. (#76)
- Created new ``force_rust_libm`` feature to force the use of a slower, 100% Rust, libm implementation. This is useful for building on WASM. (#106)
- Optimized floating point math operations available through the `Float` extension trait. (#77)
- Added text metrics getters to the `Text` widget. (#83)
- Added alignment support for the `Text` widget. (#85)
- `CompetitonBuilder` functions can now return a `ControlFlow` in order to explicitly end execution. (#89)
- `Point2` can now be converted to mint when using the `nalgebra` feature. (#91)

### Fixed

- Fixed a typo in some conditional compilation for the `smart_leds_trait` and `embedded_graphics` features that prevented them from being enabled.
- Peripherals can now be mutated in the main function (#75)
- Panic messages now output over serial even on `display_panics` feature.

### Changed

- Updated ``vex-sdk`` to version 0.17.0. (#76)
- Renamed ``ColdHeader`` to ``CodeSignature``. (#76) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed the entrypoint symbol from ``_entry`` to ``_start``. (#76) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed ``__stack_start`` and ``__stack_end`` symbols to ``__stack_top`` and ``__stack_bottom`` respectively. (#76) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed the ``.cold_magic`` section to ``.code_signature``. (#76) (**Breaking Change**)
- Made fields on screen widgets public. (#81)
- Renamed `Competition` to `CompetitionRuntime`, `CompetitionRobotExt` to `CompetitionExt`, and `CompetitionRobot` to `Competition`. (#87) (**Breaking Change**)
- Removed the `Error` associated type from the `Competition` trait and made all methods infallible. (#87) (**Breaking Change**)

### Removed

- The `no-banner` feature has been removed from `vexide-startup` and must now be toggled through the `vexide:main` attribute. (#102) (**Breaking Change**)
- Removed the useless ``__rodata_start`` and ``__rodata_end`` symbols.
- Support for `vexide-math` has been dropped. (#78) (**Breaking Change**)
- Removed the `vexide-graphics` crate and associated features (containing embedded-graphics and slint drivers) from the main vexide crate due to licensing concerns. These drivers will be available as crates licensed separately from the main `vexide` project. (#297) (**Breaking Change**)

### New Contributors

- Corrected incorrect axis getters in the `Controller` API.
