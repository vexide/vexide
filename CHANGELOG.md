### New Contributors

@zabackary made their first contribution in #164!


## [0.4.2]

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue related to the calling convention of vex-sdk functions causing docs.rs api reference build failures. (#165)

### Changed

### Removed

### New Contributors

## [0.4.1]

### Added

### Fixed

- Updated to vex-sdk 0.21.0, fixing ABI incompatibilities between the VEXos calling convention and the hard-float ABI introduced in vexide 0.4.0. This should fix broken functions that pass floats to the SDK. (#156)

### Changed

### Removed

### New Contributors

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Added support for the V5 GPS Sensor (#79)
- Added support for custom banner themes configurable through the `vexide::main` macro (#127)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the distance sensor relative_size returned a u32 when it can be negative. (#116)
- Fixed an issue preventing the `Screen::draw_buffer` function from working properly. (#128)
- Fixed an issue where panic messages would not be displayed even when the `display_panics` feature was enabled if the screens render mode was set to `DoubleBuffered`. (#134)
- `GpsImu` should now validate on the correct port. (#141)

### Changed

- Refactored the distance sensor API. All readings from the sensor are now read at once in a `object` method that can be possibly `None` if no object was detected. (#122) (**Breaking Change**)
- Adjusted distance sensor status code errors to be more clear.
- Overhauled the design of the startup banner.
- Adjusted distance sensor error names. (#113) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed `SmartDevice::port_index` and `SmartPort::index` to `SmartDevice::port_number` and `SmartPort::port_number`. (#121) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed `AdiDevice::port_index` and `AdiPort::index` to `AdiDevice::port_number` and `AdiDevice::port_number`. (#121) (**Breaking Change**)
- `SmartPort::device_type` now no longer returns a `Result`. (#121) (**Breaking Change**)
- Updated the names of certain misspelled `enum` variants, constants, and fields. (#132) (**Breaking Change**)
- Marks many futures as `#[must_use]` to warn when futures are created without `await`ing them. (#112)
- Renamed `Screen` and its associated structs to `Display`. (#138) (**Breaking Change**)
- Changes the banner attribute syntax in the `vexide::main` macro. (#127) (**Breaking Change**)
- Controller joystick axis getters now return `f64` instead of `f32`. (#133) (**Breaking Change**)
- Fixed an issue where the async executor would block indefinetly on the first program run after a Brain reboot (#139)
- Removed the `critical_section` module from `vexide_core`, since vexide doesn't use interrupts and it can potentially break VEXos operations. (#144) (**Breaking Change**)
- Switched to a hard-float libm build with up to 6 times faster floating point operations. (#145)

### Removed

### New Contributors

## [0.3.0]

- Added the ``ProgramOwner``, ``ProgramType``, and ``ProgramFlags`` types for code signature configuration. (#76)
- Created new ``force_rust_libm`` feature to force the use of a slower, 100% Rust, libm implementation. This is useful for building on WASM. (#106)

- Removed the `Error` associated type from the `Competition` trait and made all methods infallible. (#87) (**Breaking Change**)

### Removed

- The `no-banner` feature has been removed from `vexide-startup` and must now be toggled through the `vexide:main` attribute. (#102) (**Breaking Change**)
