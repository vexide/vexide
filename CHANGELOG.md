## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added several missing derived trait implementations for many device error types. (#331)
- Added support for task-local data storage using the new `task_local!` macro. This is closely modeled after `thread_local!`s in the standard library. (#333)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with `Metadata::len` using the wrong condition. (#314)
- Fixed backwards assertion logic causing a panic in `AiVision::color` and `AiVision::set_color`. (#316)
- `vexide::startup::startup` no longer handles banner printing and no longer takes arguments. If you wish to print a banner without using `#[vexide::main]`, consider using `vexide::startup::banner::print` instead. (#313) (**Breaking Change**)
- Symbols within the internal implementation of the patcher's `memcpy` will no longer clash with some libc compiler intrinsics. This should only matter if are linking to C libraries. (#314)
- Fixed a signature validation problem in the original `VisionSensor`. (#319)
- Fixed `AdiDigital*::is_low` improperly returning `is_high` (#324)

### Changed

- Renamed `File::tell` to `File::stream_position`, made Public and Infaliable. (#314)
- Renamed `RotationSensor::set_computation_interval` to `RotationSensor::set_data_interval`. (#329) (**Breaking Change**)

### Removed

- Removed `stride` from `Display::draw_buffer`, fixing a buffer size validation error. If you wish to specify the stride, use `vex-sdk` directly instead. (#323) (**Breaking change**)

### New Contributors

- GLS <<contact@glstudios.org>> made their first contribution in #314!
- @fibonacci61 made their first contribution in #333!

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Added the `FsString` `PathBuf` types as mutable and owned equivalents to `FsStr` and `Path`. (#296)
- Added `read_dir`, `ReadDir`, and `DirEntry` to `vexide_core::fs` for directory reading support. (#296)
- Implemented `PartialOrd` for `Version`. (#288)
- Added `RadioLink::INTERNAL_BUFFER_SIZE` constant. (#293)
- `AiVisionSensor` is now re-exported through `vexide::devices`. (#302)
- Added a new `GpsSensor::set_offset` method that allows reconfiguring the GPS sensor's physical offset after creation. (#302)
- Added the `vexide::program::abort` method to match `std::process::abort`. Unlike `vexide::program::exit`, `abort` attempts to terminate the program as immediately as possible without doing any cleanup to the serial buffer. (#309)
- Added `Deref` implementation back to `LazyLock`, which will panic if lazy initialization is performed recursively. (#310)
- Added `DerefMut` implementation and `force_mut` functionto `LazyLock`. (#310)
- Added `Once::try_call_once` which will return an error if called from within itself rather than returning a future. (#310)

### Fixed

- Added a missing `Drop` implementation to `File` that will close and flush the file descriptor. (#295)
- Fixed an issue where printing large amounts of data to `Stdout` without ticking the executor would immediately exit the program. (#296)
- `StdoutRaw::flush` now flushes the outgoing serial buffer (#296)
- Fixed an issue with `AdiEncoder` potentially configuring the wrong port. (#301)
- Fixed flipped assert logic when writing to the controller screen. (#300)

- Moved `vexide::core` modules to the top-level `vexide` crate. For example, `vexide::core::fs` is now `vexide::fs`. (#305) (**Breaking Change**)
- `InertialSensor::calibrate`, `AdiGyroscope::calibrate`, `DynamicPeripherals` methods, `OpenOptions` methods, and `Text::align` are now callable in `const fn` context. (#308)
- `vexide::allocator` is no longer cfg-gated to `target_vendor = "vex"`. (#307)
- Refactored the GPS Sensor API to provide all functionality through a single struct. (#302) (**Breaking Change**)
- Renamed `LazyLock::get` back to `LazyLock::force`. (#310) (**Breaking Change**)
- The default `talc` allocator can now be removed by disabling the `allocator` feature, which is enabled by default. (#311) (**Breaking Change**)

- Removed the `vexide::core` module in favor of top-level modules of the `vexide` crate. (#305) (**Breaking Change**)
