## Full Codebases

Fully functional robot programs.

> [!NOTE]
> These can be used as starting points for your own programs if you don't know where to begin.

### [`split_arcade_drive`](./split_arcade_drive.rs)

Implements a drivetrain controlled through arcade drive split between both joysticks on the primary controller.

### [`tank_drive`](./tank_drive.rs)

Implements a full tankdrive drivebase.

### [`clawbot`](./clawbot.rs)

A reimplementation of the PROS clawbot example using vexide.

## Devices

Examples of using specific devices or categories of devices.

### [`adi_expander`](./adi_expander.rs)

Showcases creating a ADI device on an ADI expander.

### [`adi`](./adi.rs)

Showcases creating and reading from several ADI devices on the Brain's built in ADI ports.

### [`ai_vision`](./ai_vision.rs)

Prints the number of objects detected by an AI Vision device in color detection mode in a loop.

### [`pneumatics`](./pneumatics.rs)

Controls pneumatics through an ADI solenoid device.

### [`display`](./display.rs)

Showcases writing text to the display through `write!`, drawing a shape, both filled and outlined, and filling the display with a solid color.

### [`smart_devices`](./smart_devices.rs)

Creates and communicates with several smart devices.

### [`vexlink_manager`](./vexlink_manager.rs) & [`vexlink_worker`](./vexlink_worker.rs)

Demonstrates basic usage of the VEXlink protocol for wireless message passing between two radios. These examples will need to be uploaded to two different robots (one "manager robot" and one "worker robot") each with their own radios in port 21.

## Async

Examples showcasing vexide's async capabilities

### [`competition`](./competition.rs)

Demonstrates how the [`Compete`](https://docs.rs/vexide/latest/vexide/core/competition/trait.Compete.html) trait can be used to run code during specific competition states.

### [`async`](./async.rs)

Explains and showcases several features of vexide's async executor including:

- Tasks
- Sleep futures
- Blocking on a future

### [`sync`](./sync.rs)

Demonstrates the usage of the asynchronous synchronization primitives included in [`vexide-core`](https://docs.rs/vexide/0.4.2/vexide/core/sync/index.html).

### [`task_local_storage`](./task_local_storage.rs)

Showcases the use of task-local storage across multiple tasks.

## Macro

Examples related to the `vexide::main` macro.

### [`bannerless`](./bannerless.rs)

The banner at program startup can be fully disabled by passing `banner(enabled = false)` to the `vexide::main` macro.

### [`themed_banner`](./themed_banner.rs)

As well as optionally disabling the banner, you can change its color theme by passing a theme to the `vexide::main` macro: `banner(theme = <THEME_CONST>)`.
Several default themes can be found in the [`vexide::startup::banner::themes`](https://docs.rs/vexide/latest/vexide/startup/banner/themes/index.html) module.

### [`custom_code_sig`](./custom_code_sig.rs)

Uses the `vexide::main` macro to set a custom code signature for the example. A custom code signature can be used to slightly alter the way a program runs. For example, the default screen colors can be inverted.

## Misc

Miscelaneous examples.

### [`basic`](./basic.rs)

A simple hello world example program. This is commonly used by vexide contributors to test changes to the runtime.

### [`fs`](./fs.rs)

A program using the filesystem API.
The filesystem is often used to store log files.
